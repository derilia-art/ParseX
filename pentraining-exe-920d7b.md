While it is an official Microsoft product, users have raised concerns regarding its safety, as some antivirus programs may mistakenly flag it as a potential virus or malware due to its executable nature. Common errors associated with PenTraining.exe include compatibility issues with newer operating systems and occasional crashes during startup, which can lead to frustration among users.
